 - **Phone Lookup**: Allow you to search for a phone number's operator. Work with Arcep databases, so only phone numbers located in France will work. I made it because I wanted a way to easly differentiate legitimate call from scams and ads, as scammers and advertisers often call from call centers. So when the operator is something like 'Menytel France' it's 90% a scam or an ad.
