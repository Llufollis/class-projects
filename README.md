 - **Crash 'em all**: 'Space physics' simulator where each planets are attracted by the others. There is some funny bugs.

 - **Maze**: Carve a random maze and resolve it, you can also save the maze to a binary file.
 
 - **Phone Lookup**: Allow you to search for a phone number's operator. Work with Arcep databases, so only phone numbers located in France will work. I made it because I wanted a way to easly differentiate legitimate call from scams and ads, as scammers and advertisers often call from call centers. So when the operator is something like 'Menytel France' it's 90% a scam or an ad.
 
 - **image in image steganography**: Allow you to hide/unhide an image in a another base image by modifying the last n-bits of each color in each pixel. Always save the output to .png.

 - **Audio Story Generator**: It can create with a few words a whole story and read it. It use Llama 3 and ljspeech and it run locally on your computer. I created a personalized system prompt so Llama 3 is way more efficient and accurate. The audio can sound a little weird, but it's because I need to separate the token array in 500 tokens length token arrays so the TTS AI don't spill out thousands of errors because I gave it a array of 2000 tokens. You can use install.py to install every needed packages/create every needed folders/install AIs I used and it should work out of the box when you execute ui.py.
